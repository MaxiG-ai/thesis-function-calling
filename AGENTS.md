# Contributing to this project

- Always create a feature branch before you go to work.
- The feature branch should follow the template "ai-<descriptive name>"

# Package management

- This project uses uv for all package management
- Never run commands directly (python, pytest, etc.)
- Always prefix commands with `uv run <command>`
- Example: `uv run python script.py` not `python script.py`
- Example: `uv run pytest` not `pytest`

# Testing approach

- Never create throwaway test scripts or ad hoc verification files
- If you need to test functionality, write a proper test in the test suite
- All tests go in the `tests/` directory following the project structure
- Tests should be runnable with the rest of the suite (`uv run pytest`)
- Even for quick verification, write it as a real test that provides ongoing value

# Testing preferences

- Write all Python tests as `pytest` style functions, not unittest classes
- Use descriptive function names starting with `test_`
- Prefer fixtures over setup/teardown methods
- Use assert statements directly, not self.assertEqual
